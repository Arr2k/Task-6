# Task-6
create strong password and evaluate its strength

we did try checking 3 kinds of password based on its complexity: weak, strong and very strong

From the evaluation, very strong passwords usually:

Use at least 12 characters (longer is always better)

Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

Avoid dictionary words and predictable patterns

Consider passphrases — random words joined with symbols/numbers (e.g., Tiger!Moon4Glass%Wave)

COMMON PASSWORD ATTACK:

Brute Force Attack: Tries all possible combinations until it finds the correct one. Longer, more complex passwords make this take exponentially longer

Dictionary Attack: Uses a list of common words/phrases. Avoids purely dictionary-based passwords

Credential Stuffing: Uses leaked username/password combos from breaches

Phishing: Tricks you into revealing your password

HOW COMPLEXITY AFFECTS SECURITY:

Length exponentially increases resistance to brute force

Character variety increases possible combinations

Randomness prevents attackers from guessing based on patterns

A strong password can turn an attack time from seconds into millions of years — making it practically uncrackable
